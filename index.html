<p>Debrief Sheet</p>

<p>Thank you for taking part in our study.</p>

<p>A consistent finding in depression research is that women are approximately twice as likely than men to have depression, typically scoring higher on scales measuring depressive symptoms. This remains the case in cross-national studies and is largely true across age groups after adolescence and. The reason for this gender gap is still debated, with varying theories including biological determinants, gender-specific social stressors or gender-specific reactions to stressors.</p>

<p>The Response Style Theory explains this disparity.  It suggests that men and women respond differently to negative life experiences or stressors, or the ways in which they use emotion regulation strategies to cope with these feelings. Women will ruminate on their feelings more in response to stress or negative life events, whereas men will not.  Our study aimed to replicate these findings while also taking into account other variables that could expand on the theory.  In particular, we aim to look at the theory that this gender disparity can also be explained by adherence to masculine stereotypes.</p>

<p>The current study aimed to combine the Response Style Theory with masculine self-concept and depressive symptoms.  We hope to further findings of previous research by demonstrating that identifying with masculine stereotypes is detrimental to help-seeking behaviours, the ability to regulate emotions and depressive symptoms.</p>
